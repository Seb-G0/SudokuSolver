This is a simple Sudoku solver program written in Python. It uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. Sudoku is a popular logic-based number placement game.

The solver takes an unsolved Sudoku grid as input, where empty cells are represented by zeros, and fills in the grid with the correct numbers to complete the puzzle. It checks row, column, and 3x3 subgrid constraints to ensure a valid solution.
